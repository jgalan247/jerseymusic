      <p class="mb-2">
        <strong>Jersey Music acts as an AGENT on behalf of event organizers.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        When you purchase tickets through our platform, the contract for the event is formed
        <strong>directly between you (the customer) and the event organizer</strong>, NOT between
        you and Jersey Music/Coderra.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        <strong>What this means for you:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-0">
        <li>The event organizer is responsible for hosting and delivering the event</li>
        <li>The event organizer handles cancellations, refunds, and event changes</li>
        <li>Jersey Music facilitates the transaction and provides the ticketing platform</li>
        <li>We collect payment on behalf of the organizer and transfer funds to them</li>
