  <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>

  <p>
    This website acts as an <strong>Agent</strong> on behalf of independent artists and organisers
    (“Vendors”). When you purchase an item or ticket through this site, the contract is
    between <strong>you</strong> and the <strong>Vendor</strong>, not with us directly.
  </p>

  <h2>Refunds</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Refund requests must be made within 14 days of purchase unless the Vendor states otherwise.</li>
    <li>Refunds are subject to the Vendor’s individual policy. We provide the platform and tools 
        (such as the "Request Refund" option in your account) but do not authorise or process refunds directly.</li>
    <li>If approved by the Vendor, refunds will be returned to the original payment method 
        within 5–10 business days.</li>
    <li>Digital products (e.g. tickets, downloads) may be non-refundable once delivered, 
        unless required by law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cancellations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you wish to cancel an order before it is fulfilled, you should contact the Vendor immediately.</li>
    <li>Cancellations are granted at the discretion of the Vendor. We cannot guarantee that cancellation is possible once an order is confirmed.</li>
    <li>For ticketed events, if the Vendor cancels the event, you will normally be entitled to a full refund. 
        This will be managed by the Vendor.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Our Role as Agent</h2>
  <p>
    We do not set refund or cancellation terms for Vendors. Our role is to act as an Agent, 
    providing a platform where you and Vendors can interact. Any disputes regarding refunds or 
    cancellations should be raised directly with the Vendor.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have difficulty reaching a Vendor through the platform, please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:info@example.com">info@example.com</a> and we will assist in passing your request on.
