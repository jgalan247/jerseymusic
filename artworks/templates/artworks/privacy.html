  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. 
    This policy explains what information we collect, how it is used, and your rights.
  </p>

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    We operate this website as an <strong>Agent</strong> for independent artists and organisers (“Vendors”).
    When you make a purchase, the contract is between you and the Vendor. 
    We provide the platform and facilitate communication and transactions.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>For customers:</strong> your name and email address, so that you can be contacted about your order and receive confirmations.</li>
    <li><strong>For vendors (artists):</strong> account details such as name, email, and where relevant, technical identifiers such as your SumUp <em>merchant ID</em> to route payments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do not store payment card details. All payments are processed securely by third-party 
    providers (e.g. SumUp). We receive confirmation of payment but not your card information.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To allow you to create an account and log in.</li>
    <li>To contact you about your purchases or account activity.</li>
    <li>To pass necessary details to the Vendor so they can fulfil your order.</li>
    <li>To associate Vendors with their payment account (e.g. via SumUp merchant ID).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We share customer name/email with the Vendor so they can process your order.</li>
    <li>We share information with payment providers (e.g. SumUp) to complete transactions.</li>
    <li>We do not sell your personal data to third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    You can request access, correction, or deletion of your personal data at any time 
    by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@example.com">info@example.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Vendors’ Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>
    Vendors may also collect and process customer information in order to fulfil orders 
    and run their businesses. Vendors are responsible for their own compliance with 
    data protection law.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please check this page regularly for updates.
