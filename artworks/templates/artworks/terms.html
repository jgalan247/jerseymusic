  <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to our website. By using this site, you agree to these Terms & Conditions. 
    If you do not agree, please do not use the site.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Role as Agent</h2>
  <p>
    We operate this website as an <strong>Agent</strong> on behalf of independent artists, 
    event organisers, and vendors (“Vendors”). When you make a purchase on this site, 
    the contract is formed between <strong>you</strong> and the <strong>Vendor</strong>, 
    not directly with us. We provide the platform and act as a facilitator of the transaction, 
    but we are not the seller of the goods, artworks, or tickets.
  </p>

  <h2>Purchases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All prices are displayed in GBP (£) and include applicable taxes unless stated otherwise.</li>
    <li>Payment must be made in full before your order is processed.</li>
    <li>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel transactions if fraudulent activity is suspected.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Refunds & Cancellations</h2>
  <p>
    Refunds and cancellations are subject to the Vendor’s own policy. We provide tools 
    (such as the “Request Refund” option) to allow you to submit requests, but the decision 
    and responsibility for refunds or cancellations lies with the Vendor. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If an event is cancelled by the Vendor, you will normally be entitled to a full refund, managed by the Vendor.</li>
    <li>If you wish to cancel an order, you must contact the Vendor directly. We cannot guarantee cancellation once the order has been confirmed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Use of Website</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You agree not to misuse the website or attempt to disrupt its functionality.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for ensuring your login details remain confidential.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    All content on this site (text, images, code) is owned by us or our Vendors. 
    You may not copy, reproduce, or reuse content without permission.
  </p>

  <h2>Liability</h2>
  <p>
    As an Agent, we are not liable for the performance, quality, or fulfilment of goods or services sold by Vendors. 
    Our liability is limited to providing the platform and ensuring it functions as described. 
    Any claims regarding the goods, artworks, or events must be directed to the Vendor.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms & Conditions from time to time. Continued use of the site 
    indicates your acceptance of any updated terms.
  </p>
