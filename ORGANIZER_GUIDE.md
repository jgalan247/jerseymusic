## 💰 Understanding Pricing

### Platform Fee Tiers

Jersey Events uses capacity-based pricing:

| Your Event Size | Tier | Fee Per Ticket |
|-----------------|------|----------------|
| Up to 50 | Tier 1 | £0.50 |
| Up to 100 | Tier 2 | £0.45 |
| Up to 250 | Tier 3 | £0.40 |
| Up to 400 | Tier 4 | £0.35 |
| Up to 500 | Tier 5 | £0.30 |
| 500+ | Custom | Contact us |

**The tier is determined automatically based on your event capacity.**

### How Platform Fees Work

**Example: 100-ticket event**

```
Your event capacity: 100 tickets
Your tier: Tier 2 (up to 100 capacity)
Platform fee: £0.45 per ticket sold

If you sell all 100 tickets:
Platform fee total: £45.00 (100 × £0.45)
```

**You only pay for tickets actually sold, not for capacity.**

---

## 💳 Processing Fee Options

SumUp charges a 1.69% processing fee for card payments. You choose who pays:

### Option 1: Customer Pays (Recommended)

**How it works:**
- Processing fee added to ticket price
- Customer sees final price at checkout
- You receive full ticket price minus platform fee

**Example:**
```
Ticket price:       £25.00
Processing fee:     £0.42 (1.69%)
─────────────────────────────
Customer pays:      £25.42

Your revenue:
Ticket price:       £25.00
Platform fee:       -£0.45
─────────────────────────────
You receive:        £24.55 per ticket
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Higher revenue per ticket
- ✅ More predictable earnings
- ✅ Common industry practice

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Slightly higher price for customers

### Option 2: You Absorb Processing Fee

**How it works:**
- Processing fee deducted from your revenue
- Customer pays base ticket price
- You receive ticket price minus both fees

**Example:**
```
Ticket price:       £25.00
Processing fee:     £0.42 (1.69%)
Platform fee:       £0.45
─────────────────────────────
Customer pays:      £25.00

Your revenue:
Ticket price:       £25.00
Platform fee:       -£0.45
Processing fee:     -£0.42
─────────────────────────────
You receive:        £24.13 per ticket
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simpler pricing for customers
- ✅ May increase conversions

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Lower revenue per ticket (£0.42 less)

### Which Option Should You Choose?

**Choose "Customer Pays" if:**
- You want maximum revenue
- You're comfortable with industry standard
- Your competitors use similar pricing

**Choose "You Absorb" if:**
- You want round-number pricing (e.g., exactly £25.00)
- You're highly price-sensitive
- Your margins can accommodate it

**Our Recommendation:** Let customers pay the processing fee. It's standard practice (Eventbrite, Ticketmaster do the same) and increases your revenue by 1.7% per ticket.

- ✅ Set appropriate min/max purchase limits
- ✅ Monitor which tiers sell fastest

**Don't:**
